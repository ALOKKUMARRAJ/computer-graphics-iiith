					In digital display systems, everything that is displayed, is displayed in terms of a smallest unit of display, which is called a pixel.
					This is in contrast to what we perceive the world to be as continuous.
					The space occupied by any image in digital display system is measured in terms of pixels.
					Thus we require to transform the continuous space in which we define he geometry of any figure to a discrete space for display in digital displays. This transformation is called <b>rasterization</b> or <b>scan conversion</b><br /><br />
					When a polygon is transformed from a set of edges in the continous form of <i>y = mx + c</i> into a set of pixels occupied by the interior of the polygon, this transformation is called <b>polygon rasterization</b>.
					Thus when we apply polygon rasterization technique on a polygon, we obtain the set of pixels that are required to be filled in order to fill the entire interior area bounded by the edges of the polygon in the best possible manner.
					Some common algorithms to perform polygon rasterization are as follows:
					<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
						<li>Scan-Line Polygon Fill algorithm</li>
						<li>Seed Fill or Boundary Fill algorithm</li>
					</ol>
					Here we have discussed only the Scan-Line Polygon Fill algorithm.

					<h2>Scan Line Polygon Fill Algorithm</h2>
					<h4>Pseudo Code of the algorithm</h4>
					Input : Vertices of the polygon, (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) &forall;i = {1, 2, ..., n}, n = #vertices in the polygon.
<pre>
We have the following data structures to maintain data:
<ul>
<li><u>Edge Table</u> (ET) : Contains all the edges (except horizontal edges) of the polygon sorted by their smaller y-coordinates. All the edges having equal smaller y-coordinates are kept in the same bucket, where they are sorted by the corresponding x-coordinate.</li>
<li><u>Active Edge Table</u> (AET) : Contains the edges that intersect with the current scan line. For each scan line, the edges are sorted in an increasing order of the x coordinate of the point of intersection.</li>
</ul>
<ol type=i>
<li>Traverse Edges to construct an Edge Table</li>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate horizontal edges</li>
<li>Add edge to linked-list for the scan line corresponding to the lower vertex.
Store the following:
<ol type=a>
<li>y_upper : last scanline to consider</li>
<li>x_lower : starting x coordinate for edge</li>
<li>1/m : to compute for incrementing x
</ol></li>
</ul>
<li>Construct Active Edge Table during scan conversion. AEL is a linked list of active edges on the current scanline, y. Each active edge line has the following information:
<ol type=a>
<li>y_upper : last scanline to consider</li>
<li>x_lower : edgeâ€™s intersection with current y</li>
<li>1/m : x increment</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
The active edges are kept sorted by x.
<fieldset>
<legend><u>Steps of the Algorithm</u></legend>
<ol>
<li>Set y to the smallest y coordinate that has an entry in the ET; i.e, y for the first nonempty bucket.</li>
<li>Initialize the AET to be empty.</li>
<li>Repeat until the AET and ET are empty:
<ul>
<li>Move from ET bucket y to the AET those edges whose y_min = y (entering edges).</li>
<li>Remove from the AET those entries for which y = y_max (edges not involved in the next scanline), the sort the AET on x (made easier because ET is presorted).</li>
<li>Fill in desired pixel values on scanline y by using pairs of x coordinates from AET.</li>
<li>Increment y by 1 (to the coordinate of the next scanline).</li>
<li>For each nonvertical edge remaining in the AET, update x for the new y.</li>
</ul></li>

					Objective of this experiment is to understand the steps of <u>filling</u> a polygon in a 2D frame buffer. Given the vertices of the polygon, the experiment outputs a filled polygon. Here we have demonstrated the steps of Scan Line Poylgon Fill algorithm.

					 <ol>
					 <li> Fix the size of the frame buffer (the default parameters are already filled in the input boxes) and then click on <b>Enter</b>.<br />
					 You can also proceed directly to the experiment using the default parameters of the size of frame buffer and the vertices of a polygon, by clicking on <b>Start Experiment with Default Values</b>.</li>
					 <li> Enter the vertices of the polygon in the input box.<br />
					 Let, (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>), (x<sub>4</sub>, y<sub>4</sub>), (x<sub>5</sub>, y<sub>5</sub>)<br /> represent the vertices of the polygon in order, i.e., the 1<sup>st</sup> vertex is connected to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> to the 3<sup>rd</sup> and so on. The last vertex is connected to the 1st to complete the polygon.<br />
					 The default vertices are already filled in the input boxes. Once you have finalized the coordinates, you can click on <b>Start Experiment</b> to begin with the experiment.<br />
					 You can also go <b>Back</b> to change the values of the frame buffer.</li>
					 <li> Throughout the experiment, you can click on <b>Next</b> to go tothe next step of the algorithm and <b>Back</b> to go to the previous step.</li>
					 <li>Once the experiment ends, you can again experiment with a new set of vertices of the polygon.</li>
